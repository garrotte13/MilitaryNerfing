  Info:
    - Fixing piercing ammo recipe disbalance introduced in Factorio2.0
    - Fixing rockets ammo reccipe disbalance introduced in Factorio2.0 - for Bob's Warfare vanilla ammo was only made hidden
    - Bob greenhouses don't cheat with abundant free energy. Required water greatly increased (hope you don't get it from free offshore pumps).
      In the very early game a smart player should switch energy supply between greenhouses and electric labs/electrolysis (till steam engines)
    - Bob MCI steel plates recipe made less cheating, but still softer comparing to vanilla if cheap still is On
    - Default underground pipes and belts are offered to be shorter to be in line with the principle of mass conservation
